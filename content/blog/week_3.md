# Kinetic sculptures

While researching different types of kinetic sculptures, I was really intrigued by wire sculptures. The thin lines are really elegant and I like how objects connected to the wires move.

These types of sculptures reminded my of a [Hills Hoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hills_Hoist), typically found in Australia and is used to hang dry clothes (dryers are alot less common there), it spins around when it's windy and also a fundamental instrument in Australian university culture. I thought it would be cool to make a wire sculpture that resembles a Hills Hoist and spins around using a motor, along with some figurines that move up and down around the hills hoist.

My plan is to use wire to build it because it's the same material and color as the classic hills hoist.

My initial plan was to make everything using one piece of wire and elegant bends but wire is really hard to work with by hand. Everytime I tried to wrap the wire around or bend a new part of the wire, another part of the wire which I already completed would go out of shape. I ran into alot of issues this week while working with wire... I tried making wire gears and then realized that you needed a special wire-bending tool to make those gears. Since I couldn't do everything in one piece, I thought that I would 'just be able to' solder wires together to attach the separate pieces of wire together but when I tried to solder wire together the solder wouldn't stick. THE BIGGEST PITA!

I had to change my plan a little and use laser-cut gears instead of wire gears, and attaching the sculpture to a box instead of it being attached to a wire cog.

To measure the circuit I measured the voltage across the motor with the load (4.92V), and also attached the multimeter in continuity mode to measure the resistance of the motor and using Ohm's law calculate the current to be 2.5$\mu A$. This means the wattage is ~0.1W which is really small.
