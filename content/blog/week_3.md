# Kinetic sculptures

While researching different types of kinetic sculptures, I was really intrigued by wire sculptures. The thin lines are really elegant and I like how objects connected to the wires move.

These types of sculptures reminded my of a [Hills Hoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hills_Hoist), typically found in Australia and is used to hang dry clothes (dryers are alot less common there), it spins around when it's windy and also a fundamental instrument in Australian university culture. I thought it would be cool to make a wire sculpture that resembles a Hills Hoist and spins around using a motor, along with some figurines that move up and down around the hills hoist.
