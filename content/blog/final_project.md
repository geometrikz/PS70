I have two ideas

# PassioGo Tracker

Inspired by MBTA tracker.

I came across this website [TrainTrackr](https://www.traintrackr.io) from a FB ad which tracks the MBTA trains in real time. I thought it would be cool to make a similar website for the Harvard Shuttle's on PassioGo since the app is so bad.

# Hydroponic Indoor Herb Greenhouse

I love cooking, and my number one biggest pet peeve is having to go to the grocery store to buy fresh herbs. It's likely that I will continue to live in places without a garden, so it will be hard to grow my own herbs outside plus the climate in the north-east isn't suited for year-round herbs. Oh, and I'm also really bad at taking care of plants, so whatever I try and grow has to be automated.

1. Herbs go bad real fast and freezing them doesn't really work.
2. They're kinda expensive (at least it adds up real fast) and you can't get a good variety at the store.
3. You always need a herb that you don't want.

Aerogardens are kinda expensive (~$200), crowds easily and not very modular.

## Specifications and goals

1. Modular system - stack them vertically, each plant in it's own container
2. As automated as possible - microcontroller, sensors, grow lights + reflectors, water pumps, etc.
3. Low maintenance
