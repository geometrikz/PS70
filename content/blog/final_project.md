*What if we could create a digital pet that you could talk to, and adapts to your personality?*

## Motivation

Growing up, I had many different types of digital pets. The first was a Tamagotchi, then it was a Digimon Digivice (basically a tamagotchi that you could use to battle your friends). These were the main two hand-held devices, before digital pets were brought to a game console, such as the Nintendo DS, where I had a digital dog called Nintendogs, and even the Switch where I had a digital cat in Little Friends: Cats and Dogs.

However, there were two things lacking in all these versions. 

**Issue with handheld tamagochi's**

First, the handheld tamagotchi's were "dumb". They did not have any online features, and they also didn't have many functions. You basically fed your pet and played with it, using 2-3 buttons to make sure it didn't die but it really didn't feel like a pet. 

**Issue with digital pets on consoles**

The point of a 'tamagochi' was lost on the console. On both the switch and the DS, your digital pet was a 'game' and you had to load the right cartridge to play with your pet. Since these games weren't as fun as other games, these cartidges weren't loaded that frequently. Furthermore, although these pets were much more interactive, and you were able to talk to them. The form-factor of the console made it hard to carry around and also distracts you from playing around with it.

**Issue with digital pets on mobile**

Mobile phones 


## Capbabilities

* Talk to your pet (Microphone)
* Pet talks back (Speaker)
* Being able to see your pet, and interact with an interface (LCD Screen)
* Physical interaction (Buttons)
* Wireless (Battery and WiFi)
* Personality and voice recognition (Machine Learning)

## Use cases

* asdsad

## Prototype
### Materials
* ESP32-S2 DevKit
* IMNP441 I2S Microphone
* 128x64 I2C OLED Display
* 6x6x6 Tactile Push Button

For the MVP prototype, I bread-boarded the electronic circuit in an attempt to get all the electronics working together. This was a good step since it allowed me to quickly diagnose circuit issues and test how many pins I would need to use in the final design.
