The thin lines are really elegant and I like how objects connected to the wires move.\nThese types of sculptures reminded my of a Hills Hoist , typically found in Australia and is used to hang dry clothes (dryers are alot less common there), it spins around when it\u0026rsquo;s windy and also a fundamental instrument in Australian university culture.","date":"2023-02-06T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://geometrikz.github.io/PS70/blog/week_3/","tags":null,"title":"Week 3: Hand tools and fabrication"},{"author":"Geoffrey Liu","categories":null,"contents":"I have two ideas\nPassioGo Tracker Inspired by MBTA tracker.\nI came across this website TrainTrackr from a FB ad which tracks the MBTA trains in real time.
